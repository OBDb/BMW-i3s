    description: "The BMW i3s was the sportier variant of the standard i3 electric vehicle, introduced as part of the 2018 model year update. Built on the same carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) passenger cell and aluminum chassis architecture as the standard i3, the i3s featured a more powerful electric motor producing 184 HP (compared to 170 HP in the contemporary standard i3) and 199 lb-ft of torque. Performance was enhanced with 0-60 mph acceleration in approximately 6.8 seconds. Visual distinctions included a more aggressive front bumper, wider fenders with flared wheel arches to accommodate a 40mm wider track, and unique 20-inch wheels. The suspension was lowered by 10mm and sport-tuned for improved handling, while a specific Sport driving mode enhanced throttle response. Like the standard i3, the i3s was available with either a pure battery electric drivetrain or with an optional range extender gasoline engine. It shared the same battery updates as the standard model, culminating in the 42.2 kWh pack introduced in 2018 providing up to 153 miles of range. The i3s represented BMW's attempt to bring their traditional emphasis on driving dynamics to the electric vehicle segment, offering a more engaging alternative to the standard i3 while maintaining its core innovations in lightweight construction and sustainable materials."
